# Copilot Instructions

## Code Generation Guidelines

- **Be concise**: Provide direct code solutions without lengthy explanations
- **Focus on implementation**: Go straight to modifying or creating the requested code
- **No documentation files**: Do not create separate documentation files for changes made
- **Minimal comments**: Only include essential inline comments when absolutely necessary
- **Direct responses**: Answer with code blocks immediately, avoid verbose descriptions

## Response Format

- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Keep explanations to one sentence maximum
- Prioritize working code over detailed explanations
- No changelog or documentation generation unless explicitly requested
